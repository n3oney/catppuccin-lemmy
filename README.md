# catppuccin-lemmy

Catppuccin theme ported to lemmy.


## Build instructions
I have only tested this on Linux, but it should also work on macOS:
```
npm install
./build.sh
```

The themes are built to the `dist/` folder.

## Usage

You can use these themes in an extension like Stylus, or import them as custom themes for an instance you own.

## Contributing

The project needs some help.
Here's a list of issues you could help tackle:
 - [ ] latte variant has barely readable text on buttons
 - [ ] all variants have barely readable text on unselected buttons in button groups
